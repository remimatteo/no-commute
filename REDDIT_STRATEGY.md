# Reddit Strategy - Build Authority Then Promote

## Rules of Reddit

**Golden Rule:** Provide value FIRST, promote SECOND

Reddit hates spam. If you just drop links, you'll get banned. But if you're genuinely helpful, Reddit loves you.

## Phase 1: Days 1-4 (This Week) - ONLY Provide Value

### Goal: Build Karma & Credibility

**Time commitment:** 20-30 minutes per day

**What to do:**
1. Browse each subreddit for 5-10 min
2. Find 2-3 questions you can answer
3. Write helpful, detailed responses
4. **Don't mention your site yet!**

### Example Questions to Answer:

**"How do I stay productive working from home?"**
Your response:
```
I've been fully remote for 3 years. Here's what actually works:

1. Morning routine: Wake up, shower, get dressed like you're going to an office. It mentally prepares you.

2. Dedicated workspace: Doesn't need to be fancy. Just a spot that's ONLY for work. Your brain will associate it with focus.

3. Pomodoro technique: 25 min work, 5 min break. Sounds simple but it works. I use the Forest app.

4. Set boundaries: Work 9-5, then STOP. Close your laptop. Leave your workspace.

5. Overcommunicate: In remote work, silence = you're not working. Update your team more than feels necessary.

The hardest part? Discipline. No one's watching. You need self-motivation.
```

**"Is remote work lonely?"**
Your response:
```
It can be, but it doesn't have to be.

I was lonely the first 3 months. Then I figured it out:

• Coworking spaces 2x per week (social interaction + productivity)
• Virtual coffee chats with coworkers
• Join local meetups (in your city, not work-related)
• Video calls > Slack messages (seeing faces helps)
• Take calls while walking outside

The key: You need to be intentional about social interaction. It won't happen automatically like in an office.

Also: Some people LOVE the quiet. It's not for everyone, and that's okay.
```

**"Where can I find remote jobs?"**
Your response (Week 1 - NO site mention yet):
```
I've used these and they're legit:

• RemoteOK - Good mix of tech jobs
• We Work Remotely - Curated, high-quality
• FlexJobs - Paid ($15/mo) but vetted (no scams)
• AngelList - Startup jobs
• LinkedIn - Use "remote" filter

Tips:
1. Set up email alerts on 2-3 sites
2. Apply within first 4 hours of posting
3. Customize your resume for each job
4. Don't just apply - also reach out to hiring manager on LinkedIn

Most important: Be consistent. 5-10 applications daily beats 50 applications once.
```

## Phase 2: Days 5-7 (End of Week) - Subtle Mentions

### Goal: Start Mentioning Your Site (Subtly)

**Now you can mention your site, but as ONE of several options**

**"Where can I find remote jobs?"**
Your response (Week 1 - WITH site mention):
```
I use multiple sources:

• RemoteOK - Good tech job mix
• We Work Remotely - Curated listings
• No Commute Jobs - I actually built this one, aggregates from multiple boards
• FlexJobs - Paid but vetted
• LinkedIn - Remote filter works well

Don't rely on just one site. Set alerts on 2-3 and apply fast (within 4 hours).

Also check company career pages directly:
• GitLab
• Automattic
• Zapier
• Buffer

Good luck!
```

**Key points:**
- Mention your site as one of several
- Add context ("I built this")
- Still provide other valuable options
- Stay helpful first, promotional second

## Phase 3: Week 2+ - More Direct Promotion

### Goal: Build Authority, Share Content

Once you have 50+ karma and a post history, you can:

**1. Post your blog content:**
```
Title: "I analyzed 2000+ remote jobs to find the highest-paying roles - here's what I learned"

Body:
I run a remote job board and scraped data from 2000+ listings. Here are the surprising findings:

• Software Engineers: $120k-$180k avg
• Designers: $90k-$140k avg
• Marketing: $70k-$120k avg

Location doesn't matter for top companies. Skills do.

## What NOT to Do (Will Get You Banned)

❌ **Posting the same thing in multiple subreddits**
- Reddit tracks this
- Called "cross-posting spam"
- Instant ban

❌ **Only posting links to your site**
- No post history + link = spam
- Need 10+ helpful comments before any links

❌ **Ignoring subreddit rules**
- Each sub has different rules
- Read them BEFORE posting
- Mods ban quickly

❌ **Commenting just to promote**
- Every comment mentions your site = spam
- Ratio should be 10:1 (help:promote)

❌ **Arguing with people**
- Reddit loves downvoting arguments
- Kills your karma
- Bad for your brand

## Karma Building Strategy

### Quick Karma Boosters:
1. **Answer easy questions first**
   - "How do I get started with remote work?"
   - "What equipment do I need?"
   - These get upvoted easily

2. **Post on weekday mornings (8-10 AM EST)**
   - Most active time
   - Higher chance of upvotes

3. **Use formatting**
   - Bullet points
   - Numbers
   - Bold for emphasis
   - Makes responses easier to read = more upvotes

4. **Be the first to comment**
   - Sort by "New"
   - Answer recent questions
   - Early comments get more visibility

5. **Share personal experience**
   - "I've been remote for 3 years..."
   - People trust personal stories
   - More upvotes than generic advice

## Sample Reddit Post (For Week 2+)

### Title:
"I analyzed 2000+ remote job listings - here's what companies are really looking for"

### Body:
```
I built a remote job board and aggregated data from 2000+ listings over the past 3 months. Here are the surprising findings:

**Most In-Demand Skills:**
1. JavaScript/TypeScript (mentioned in 34% of dev jobs)
2. React (28%)
3. Python (22%)
4. Communication skills (mentioned in 67% of ALL jobs)

**Salary Trends:**
• Remote doesn't mean lower pay
• Senior dev roles: $140k-$180k avg
• Location doesn't matter for 78% of companies

**What Surprises Me:**
• "Async communication" mentioned 3x more than last year
• "Time zone overlap" now in 45% of job posts
• Companies care MORE about work samples than degrees

**Where to Look:**
I aggregate jobs from multiple sources on my site, but also check:
• RemoteOK
• We Work Remotely
• Company career pages directly

Full data breakdown: [link to blog post]

Happy to answer questions about the data!
```

**Why this works:**
- Provides real value (data)
- Establishes authority (built a job board)
- Mentions site naturally (in context)
- Invites engagement (answer questions)
- Not just promotion
