## Common Questions

### "I tried Reddit before and it didn't work"
**Why**: You likely shared links too quickly without building trust.

**Better approach**:
1. Spend 2 weeks ONLY providing value (answer questions, give advice)
2. Never mention your site in comments
3. After 2 weeks, share blog posts (not homepage) when genuinely relevant
4. Example: Someone asks "What's the average remote dev salary?" → Share your salary guide post

### "I asked many sites to link to me and no one responded"
**Why**: Generic outreach to random blogs has <1% success rate.

**Better approach**:
1. **Target specific opportunities**: Broken links, resource pages with gaps
2. **Provide value first**: "I noticed X is broken" before asking for link
3. **Use data**: "I have exclusive data on Y" is more compelling
4. **Be personal**: Reference their specific content, not a template

### "Should I start with paid ads?"
**Not yet**. Here's why:

Free methods first:
1. SEO improvements (done ✅)
2. Content marketing (starting)
3. Link building (starting)
4. Social media (starting)

These build long-term value and cost only time.

**When to consider paid**:
- After 3 months of organic growth
- When you have profitable unit economics ($99 job posting, know your conversion rate)
- To accelerate what's already working

### "How long until I see results?"
**Realistic timeline**:
- Week 1-2: No traffic change (you're planting seeds)
- Week 3-4: Small uptick from social media
- Month 2: First blog posts start ranking, backlinks begin appearing
- Month 3: Noticeable organic traffic increase
- Month 4-6: Exponential growth as more content ranks

**Why this matters**: Most people quit in weeks 2-4 because they don't see instant results. SEO and content marketing are slow, but compound over time.

## Most Important Advice

### Do This Every Day (15-30 mins)
1. **Post on social media** (or use scheduled posts)
2. **Engage**: Reply to comments, answer questions

## Remember

🚀 **Growth is a marathon, not a sprint**

You're not competing on paid ads budget. You're competing on:
- Quality of content
- Consistency of execution
- Patience to let SEO compound
- Genuine value provided to job seekers

You have a good product (2000+ jobs), good tech (Next.js, proper schema), and now a solid strategy.

**The only question is**: Will you execute consistently for 3-6 months?

If yes, you'll see real growth. If no, nothing will change.

Let's build this thing. 💪
