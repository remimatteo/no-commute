# 🔐 SECURITY REMINDER

## ✅ Your Secrets Are Safe

Your `.env.local` file contains sensitive Stripe keys and is automatically excluded from git by `.gitignore`.

### What's Protected:
- `.env.local` - Contains your Stripe keys ✅ (Already in .gitignore)
- Stripe publishable key (pk_live_...)
- Stripe secret key (sk_live_...)
- Stripe webhook secret (whsec_...)

### Files You Can Safely Commit:
- ✅ `pages/api/create-checkout-session.js` - No secrets here
- ✅ `pages/api/webhook.js` - Reads secrets from environment variables
- ✅ `pages/post-job.js` - Uses only the publishable key (safe to expose)
- ✅ All documentation files
- ✅ All other source code

### NEVER Commit These Files:
- ❌ `.env.local` (already protected by .gitignore)
- ❌ `.env` (if you create one)
- ❌ Any file with actual API keys written in it

## 🚨 Before Deploying to Production

When you deploy to Vercel/Render/other platforms:

1. **DO NOT** commit `.env.local` to git
2. **DO** add environment variables directly in your hosting dashboard:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...`
   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...`
   - `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...`
   - `DATABASE_URL=...`

3. Each hosting platform has a place to add environment variables:
   - **Vercel:** Settings → Environment Variables
   - **Render:** Dashboard → Environment → Environment Variables
   - **Heroku:** Settings → Config Vars

---

## ✅ What's Already Protected

Your `.gitignore` file includes:
```
.env*.local
```

This means:
- `.env.local` ✅ Protected
- `.env.development.local` ✅ Protected
- `.env.production.local` ✅ Protected

**You're all set! Your secrets are safe.** 🔒

## 📝 Quick Checklist

Before pushing to GitHub:
- [ ] Check that `.env.local` is NOT staged for commit
- [ ] Run `git status` to verify no secrets are being committed
- [ ] Never include API keys directly in code files
- [ ] Always use `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME` to access secrets

---

## 💡 Good Practice

Your code correctly uses environment variables:
```javascript
// ✅ GOOD - Uses environment variable
const stripe = require('stripe')(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY);

// ❌ BAD - Never do this
const stripe = require('stripe')('sk_live_actual_key_here');
```

**Your implementation is correct!** All secrets are properly loaded from environment variables.

---

**Bottom Line:** Your Stripe keys are safe and won't be committed to GitHub! 🎉
