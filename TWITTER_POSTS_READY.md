### Tweet 2 (Afternoon)

```
Your home office doesn't need to be perfect.

I worked from my kitchen table for 2 years.

What you DO need:
✅ Stable internet (50 Mbps minimum)
✅ Decent chair (your back matters)
✅ Noise-canceling headphones
✅ Set work hours

Fancy desk? Optional.

### Tweet 3 (Evening)

```
Remote work isn't:
❌ Working in PJs all day
❌ Taking 4-hour lunch breaks
❌ Never talking to anyone

Remote work is:
✅ Working when YOU'RE most productive
✅ No commute = 2 hours back daily
✅ Living where you want

It's freedom, not laziness.
