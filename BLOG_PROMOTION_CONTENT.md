## LinkedIn Post (Company Page + Personal Profile)

### Version 1: Data-Focused (Professional)
```
üìä We Analyzed 3,465 Remote Job Listings. Here's What We Found.

Remote work is here to stay, but the data reveals some uncomfortable truths:

üî¥ THE SALARY TRANSPARENCY PROBLEM
Only 28.1% of remote jobs disclose salary ranges. That means 71.9% of employers are wasting candidates' time by hiding compensation details.

Companies: List your salaries upfront. It's 2025.

‚úÖ TOP OPPORTUNITIES BY FIELD
‚Ä¢ Software Development: 483 jobs (13.9%)
‚Ä¢ Sales/Business Dev: 203 jobs (5.9%)
‚Ä¢ DevOps: 202 jobs (5.8%)
‚Ä¢ Customer Service: 192 jobs (5.5%)
‚Ä¢ Design: 176 jobs (5.1%)

Remote work isn't just for developers anymore.

üåç THE LOCATION MYTH
Only 8% of remote jobs are truly "work from anywhere." Most have geographic restrictions:
‚Ä¢ 35% require USA location
‚Ä¢ 3.5% UK-only
‚Ä¢ 3.1% Europe
‚Ä¢ 2.7% Canada

Digital nomads need to filter carefully.

üíº WHO'S HIRING?
Mercor leads with 194 active positions, followed by Capital One (7), Atlassian (6), and Samsara (6).

üìà WHAT THIS MEANS
All 3,465 jobs were posted in the last 30 days. Companies are actively building remote teams across all industries.

Remote work is the new normal.

```

### Version 2: Provocative (Gets More Engagement)
```
72% of remote job postings hide salary information.

Let that sink in.

We analyzed 3,465 remote jobs, and only 973 disclosed compensation.

This isn't just annoying‚Äîit's a systemic problem that:
‚Ä¢ Wastes job seekers' time
‚Ä¢ Perpetuates pay inequality
‚Ä¢ Benefits only employers

Here's what else we discovered:

üö® The "Work From Anywhere" Myth
Only 8% of remote jobs are truly location-agnostic.

35% require USA residency
3.5% UK-only
3.1% Europe-only

If you're a digital nomad, you're competing for a small slice of the pie.

üíª Developers Still Dominate
Nearly 20% of all remote jobs are in software engineering.

But there's hope for non-technical folks:
‚Ä¢ 203 sales positions
‚Ä¢ 192 customer service roles
‚Ä¢ 158 marketing jobs
‚Ä¢ 144 finance/legal positions

üìä Top Companies Hiring Remote
Mercor: 194 positions (!)
Capital One: 7 positions
Atlassian: 6 positions
Monzo: 6 positions

The Bottom Line:
Remote work is thriving, but not all "remote" jobs are created equal.

You need to filter aggressively for:
‚úì Salary transparency
‚úì Location flexibility
‚úì Companies with proven remote culture
