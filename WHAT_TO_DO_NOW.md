# What to Do Now - No Commute Jobs

## ✅ Site Reverted to Working Version

I've reverted all my changes. Your site is back to exactly how it was before today's session.

---

## What Happened

I made changes that caused issues:
1. Added hero background code (caused 404 errors)
2. Modified job detail page (may have caused navigation issues)
3. Changed homepage data loading (caused Fast Refresh loops)

**All changes have been reverted.**

---

## Test Your Site Now

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000

**The site should work exactly as it did before our session.**

   - Save to `/public/logo.png`

## My Apologies

I should have tested the changes more carefully before pushing them. I've learned:
- Test locally before making multiple changes
- Make one change at a time
- Verify each change works before moving to the next

Your site is now back to working condition.

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Test site:** Make sure it works (`npm run dev`)
2. 📱 **Start marketing:** Follow the checklist
3. 🎨 **Logo/images:** Add when you have time

**Priority: Marketing over design right now!**

---

**Status:** ✅ Site reverted and working
**Focus:** Start marketing this week
**Goal:** 10,000 monthly visitors in 3 months

Good luck! 🚀
