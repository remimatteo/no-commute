    author: 'Sarah_M',
    date: '2025-10-15',
    content: 'After months of applying, I finally got hired as a remote customer success manager. Here\'s what worked: I stopped using generic cover letters and started researching each company. I\'d mention specific products or recent news in my applications. Also, I made sure my home office setup was visible during video interviews - it showed I was serious about remote work.',

    content: 'Took a remote dev job last year that seemed perfect. No one mentioned the "mandatory" 6am daily standups (I\'m in PST, team was in Europe). Or that "flexible hours" meant being available 24/7. Now I know to ask: What are core hours? How do you handle time zones? What\'s the response time expectation for messages? Don\'t make my mistakes.',

    author: 'TechRecruiter_Jane',

    content: 'I was interviewing with two companies simultaneously. When Company A made an offer, I told Company B (my preferred choice) that I had another offer but really wanted to work with them. They came back with $15k more than their initial range. Key lesson: be honest but professional about competing offers. Most companies would rather pay more than lose a good candidate.',

Here\'s what separates the good from the bad: Good ones have virtual coffee chats, async communication norms, and don\'t expect instant responses. Bad ones just took office culture and slapped Zoom on it. GitLab and Zapier really get it. Traditional companies trying to "do remote" often don\'t.',
