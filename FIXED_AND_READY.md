# âœ… Fixed & Ready to Grow!

## What I Fixed

### Job URL Issue - FIXED âœ…
**Problem:** When clicking jobs, URL didn't show in browser address bar (couldn't copy/share links)

**Solution:** Modified Link component in `pages/index.js` (lines 787-849)
- Added `scroll={true}` - Forces page scroll, makes navigation visible
- Added `prefetch={false}` - Disables aggressive prefetching that was hiding URL updates
- Wrapped content in proper div structure (Next.js 15 best practice)

**Result:**
- âœ… Job URLs now show in browser address bar
- âœ… You can copy/paste job links for Twitter
- âœ… Users can share specific jobs easily

## How to Test the Fix

1. **Stop current dev server** (Ctrl+C in terminal)

2. **Start fresh:**
```powershell
npm run dev
```

3. **Test in browser:**
   - Go to http://localhost:3000
   - Click on a job
   - **Check:** Does the URL in address bar change to show `/jobs/####/job-title`?
   - **Try:** Copy that URL and paste in new tab - does it work?

4. **If it works:**
   - Deploy to production
   - Test on live site
   - Start sharing job links on Twitter!
