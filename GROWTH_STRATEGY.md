## 5. Link Building Strategy (FREE Methods)

### Tactic #1: Broken Link Building (Start This Week)
**Time Required**: 2 hours/week
**Expected Links**: 5-10 per month

Steps:
1. Use Google to find career resource pages:
   - Search: `"remote work resources" + "jobs"`
   - Search: `"career resources" + inurl:links`
   - Search: `"work from home" + "helpful links"`

2. Use browser extension "Check My Links" to find broken links on these pages

3. Email template:
   ```
   Subject: Broken link on [Page Title]

   Hi [Name],

   I was reading your article on [topic] and noticed a broken link in the resources section.

   The link to [broken site] (returns a 404) might benefit from being updated to a working alternative.

   I run No Commute Jobs, a remote job board with 2000+ verified listings. If it fits your resource page, it might be a good replacement: https://no-commute-jobs.com

   Either way, thought you'd want to know about the broken link!

   Best,
   Remi
   ```

### Tactic #2: Resource Page Inclusion
**Target**: 10-15 links in first month

University career centers:
- Search: `site:.edu "career resources" "job boards"`
- Email career services departments
- Offer: Free job posting credits for students

Career blogs and guides:
- Search: `"best remote job boards" OR "remote job sites"`
- Email authors who haven't included your site
- Value add: Offer to provide data/quotes for their article

### Tactic #3: Create a "Best Remote Job Boards 2025" Widget
**Why**: Other sites will link to you when comparing job boards

Create a simple embeddable badge:
- "Featured on No Commute Jobs"
- Encourage companies you list to add it to their careers page
- Each badge = backlink

### Tactic #4: Original Research & Data
**Why**: Journalists and bloggers link to data sources

Use your job database to publish:
- "Most In-Demand Remote Skills Q1 2025" (quarterly report)
- "Remote Work Salary Index" (monthly update)
- "Companies Hiring Most Remote Workers" (monthly leaderboard)

Outreach to:
- Tech news sites (TechCrunch, VentureBeat, The Verge)
- HR/recruitment blogs
- Career advice sites
- Subject: "Data: [Interesting finding] in Remote Job Market"

### Tactic #5: Guest Posting (Strategic, Not Spammy)
**Target**: 2-3 high-quality guest posts per month

Sites to target:
- Career advice blogs (The Muse, FlexJobs Blog, Remote.co)
- Industry-specific blogs (For the Love of Work, etc.)
- Developer communities (DEV.to, Hashnode)

Pitch template:
```
Subject: Guest post idea: [Specific Topic]

Hi [Name],

I'm Remi, founder of No Commute Jobs. I've been analyzing remote work trends and noticed [specific insight from your data].

I'd love to write a guest post for [Site Name] on "[Specific Title]" - I think your audience would find [specific value] helpful.

Quick outline:
1. [Point 1 with data]
2. [Point 2 with actionable advice]
3. [Point 3 with examples]

Happy to send a full draft if this interests you. I can also provide exclusive data from our job board to make it more valuable.

Best,
Remi
```

### Tactic #6: Community Engagement (Build Authority First)
**Reddit**: 30 mins/day, 5 days/week
- r/remotework - Answer questions, provide value
- r/digitalnomad - Share insights (NOT job links)
- r/cscareerquestions - Help with remote job search
- After 2 weeks of value, share blog posts (not homepage)

**Indie Hackers**: Weekly updates
- Share your journey building the site
- Metrics: traffic, revenue, challenges
- Ask for feedback
- Natural backlinks from IH threads

**Hacker News**: When you have a unique angle
- "Show HN: I analyzed 2000+ remote jobs to find the highest-paying remote roles"
- "Ask HN: I'm building a remote job board - what features matter to you?"
- ONLY post if you have genuinely interesting content

2. **Weekly Newsletter Template**

4. **Referral Program** (Later)

## 7. Technical SEO Improvements

### Dynamic Job Sitemap (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Current Issue**: sitemap-jobs.xml may not include all 2000+ jobs

**Solution**: Create `scripts/generate-dynamic-sitemap.js`
```javascript
// Fetch all job IDs from database
// Generate sitemap with all job URLs
// Update daily via cron job or build script
```

### Page Speed Optimization
- Already using Next.js Image optimization ‚úÖ

- Consider: Lazy load job images below fold
- Consider: Reduce initial JavaScript bundle size
