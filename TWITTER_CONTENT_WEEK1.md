```
Your home office doesn't need to be perfect.

I worked from my kitchen table for 2 years.

What you DO need:
‚úÖ Good internet (minimum 50 Mbps)
‚úÖ Decent chair (your back will thank you)
‚úÖ Noise-canceling headphones
‚úÖ Dedicated work hours

The fancy desk can wait.

### Evening - Reality Check
```
Remote work isn't:
‚ùå Working in PJs all day
‚ùå Taking 4-hour lunch breaks
‚ùå Never talking to anyone

Remote work is:
‚úÖ Flexibility to work when you're most productive
‚úÖ No commute = 2 hours back daily
‚úÖ Living where YOU want

It's about freedom, not laziness.

### Afternoon - Interview Tip
```
Remote interview tip:

Test your setup 30 minutes BEFORE the call.

‚Ä¢ Camera works?
‚Ä¢ Mic clear?
‚Ä¢ Internet stable?
‚Ä¢ Background clean?
‚Ä¢ Phone on silent?

I've seen great candidates lose offers because their video froze mid-answer.

Don't let tech issues cost you the job.

### Evening - Weekend Vibe
```
Weekend reminder:

Remote work means you CAN work from anywhere.

That coffee shop. That beach town. Your parents' house. A coworking space.

Don't let "work from home" limit you. Test different environments.

Remote work changed my life:
